# snapbot
A bot that builds snapscore

I built this out of curiosity as to how to use python to interact with html pages involving a lot of javascript.
If you want to use this - which I don't reccomend - then you first need to download chromedriver and run "pip install selenium".

All of the code was written by me with Google Gemini helping me figure stuff out and then me applying that knowledge to the snapbot.

If you want to use it, you need to edit the code itself and change the username, password and number of times to run.
